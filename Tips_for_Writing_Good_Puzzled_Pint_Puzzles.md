## Introduction

In editing Puzzled Pint puzzles over the past many years we’ve been learning what makes the puzzles fun and easy for our beginner players.  This can make the Puzzled Pint puzzle different than other hunts.  In the spirit of sharing our knowledge freely, here a living list of things that we’ve found.  We hope this list is useful to our guest authors as well as the puzzle authoring community as a whole.  Not all puzzles can be all the things below, but making use of these will make a puzzle better for Puzzled Pint player specifically, and possibly other puzzle hunts too.

## Tip #1: Make it Solvable

*“Everyone likes solving puzzles, no one likes not solving puzzles.” -- Matt Stephans*

A puzzle’s job is to be solved.  This means as much as possible the puzzle will want to lead a solver down its correct solve path to the answer.  Anything you can add to help guide player is thus a good thing.

## Tip #2: Make it Easy

*“You can’t make it too easy” - Curtis Chen*

Authors often worry about making a puzzle too easy, and in doing so make it too hard.  Puzzled Pint is not about providing a challenge to players, plenty of other puzzle hunts do that.  We’re about making the puzzles fun for beginner, not challenging experts.  We’re about giving new players confidence in their solving abilities so they can move onto the other challenges.  It’s much more like swimming laps than going for the gold.  Ideally all players would succeed every time without hints.

## Tip #3: No Red Herrings

*"Perfection is Achieved Not When There Is Nothing More to Add, But When There Is Nothing Left to Take Away" - French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupery*

Identifying a red herring is a puzzling skill in and of itself.  I can remember starting at a picture of a red fish for 20 minutes wondering “What does this mean?”.  Invariably for beginners anything extra in the puzzle will cause confusion and distract from the correct solve path.

If you have flavor text that isn’t meaningful to the puzzle it should be very distinctly delineated and consistently unmeaningful for every puzzle in the set.

If you have hint words within flavor text they should be bolded or italicized to prevent the other words from being red herrings. 

Any extra elements coming from the theme could also be red herrings, especially for those who aren’t familiar with the theme.

In short, if something looks like it could be meaningful, it should be meaningful and helpful to solve the puzzle.

## Tip #4: Give Them a Place to Start

*“The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step” - Lao Tzu*

To a beginner, a puzzle can be extremely daunting.  Therefore, puzzles should not be impenetrable.    There should be an obvious first place to start and get going and make partial progress.  

## Tip #5: Be Consistent

*“Trust is built with consistency” - Lincoln Chafee*

Consistency in your puzzle design is important for many reasons.  We say it builds trust in the puzzle author because if something works one way in one part of the puzzle, it should work in the same way in another part.  It helps puzzle acceleration by allowing players to get the easier parts and them use what they’ve learned to get the more difficult ones.  The Rule of Three should be used to note a pattern. For example, if three clues all yield one word answers, the next clue should not yield a two word answer.  If your puzzle has multiple parts of mechanisms, these should be clearly defined so that the players expect a pattern change for the other parts.

## Glossary

A Puzzled Pint puzzle, due to targeting pure beginners is unlike normal puzzle hunt puzzles.  In particular it should hold the solvers hand, providing a clear path to solving the puzzle.  Expert solvers have a repertoire of “things to try” that beginners do not.  To facilitate this, we require use of explicit flavor text/instructions, hooks, confirmers, answer confirmers, and solving aids on our puzzles.

### Preamble Text

The preamble text is the text at the top of each puzzle, below the title.  Preamble text provides the following:

- Adds ‘flavor’ to the puzzle in the form of tying the mechanism of this puzzle into the theme of the set.  Pure flavor should be in all italics to distinguish it from puzzle instructions.
- All codes and solving techniques used in the puzzle need to be clued in the preamble text.  These should be in bold in the flavor text.  While experts know to pick out references to “sight” or lack thereof as a clue to Braille, new solvers do not.  Bolding the text forces them to think about the meaning of the bolded words, thus provides a ‘hook’ (see below).  The only exceptions are the mechanisms described on our puzzling basics page, which may be assumed to known and tried by the solver (indexing, alphanumeric codes, and acrostics)
- Flavor text can also provide confirmers, including final answer confirmers (see below).
- Instruction text (generally not italicized) gives literal instructions on what to do to begin or solve the puzzle.  Use this when it’s unclear how to begin the puzzle, when using craft puzzles, or when using novel solving techniques.  Even when using standard puzzle types (like Sudoku) consider using this space to describe how they work anyhow (space permitting)

### Puzzle Levels and Depth

As beginner puzzles, these should not be too many layers deep.  Generally, our puzzles have a step where answers are obtained (using the unique puzzle mechanism), optionally reordered, and then letters are extracted in the extraction step.  Puzzles should not go deeper than this with additional solving levels as this leads to longer puzzles.  

If additional puzzle levels are used, the previous level should solve to a direct instruction like “SEMAPHORE ON GREEN ARROWS”.

### Puzzle Mechanisms

For Puzzled Pint, we’re looking for novel puzzle mechanisms used in short puzzles.  This means we generally do not want straight crossword puzzles, word searches, Sudoku, etc.  Standard puzzle types are great if they have a ‘twist’ to them that make them interesting.

Beginners and drunk people have short attention spans. As such, we recommend that no activity is to be performed more than about a dozen times.  For example, no more than 12 trivia answers to lookup, or words to fill in the grid, or pairs to match up, etc.  Our puzzles are about the “Aha!” moment, not the rote application of a known task.

### Reordering

Use reordering steps sparingly.  When beginners solve a puzzle they’re looking to see if they’re doing the right thing.  They’ll generally look for answer to be in a natural on-page order like left to right or top to bottom.  If the puzzle’s answers are intended to be reordered according to an ordering mechanism (hinted or not), beginners can abandon the correct path as it’s not giving them a nice English word as an answer.

Additionally, reordering tends to require rewriting the puzzle’s answers on scratch paper.  We discourage this because of limited space at bar tables.  Puzzles should be able to be solved-in-place on the one piece of paper whenever possible.

Do not use answers that require an anagram.  If it’s not possible to reorder the puzzle on the page so the answers are in a natural order, clue an ordering mechanism.  The easiest of these is to use numbered boxes to allow the players to get the letters in the correct order.

### Extraction

For the extraction step, most puzzles should make it very clear which letters are to be used for extraction.  We recommend the use of rectangular boxes for this purpose.  For puzzles requiring coded extraction, we provide a code sheet with many common codes.  Codes used should be hinted in the preamble text.

All puzzle answers should make use of answer blanks (on the puzzle or on the answer sheet).  These act as an answer confirmer and gives beginner solvers confidence in their answers.

### Hooks

Hooks are places to start on a puzzle.  For beginner-level puzzles, solvers should be able to start immediately without wondering what the first step might be, or without exhausting too many options.  

A jigsaw puzzle’s hooks are the corner pieces, which are quickly identified and placed as a starting point to solve.

The best hook is an **example**. For instance, a crossword-style puzzle could pre-fill the first 1-Across answer into the grid, then use strikethrough text on the clue to indicate it’s been completed.

For puzzles where this would give ‘too much’ away, there should still be some kind of starting hook, like an answer that fits into only one place due to its size, word length, orientation, etc.

### Confirmers

Beginner puzzles should make copious use of confirmers.  A confirmer is anything that tells a solver she is on the right track or has gotten a correct answer.  Getting English words, fitting answers blanks, everything being all of the same class of items, etc. all count as confirmers.

Final Answer confirmers are especially important.  In short, if you have the right answer, you should already be really sure that it’s the right answer.  For the mechanism, if you’ve found the right solving mechanism, it should be really obvious that you’re on the right track because the answers should flow easily.  To facilitate this, it’s often important that the first couple of answers that solvers are expected to get be stellar examples that fit the theme or class well.  Later answers gotten can fit less well because the mechanism has already been confirmed.

The final answer confirmer should be the last line of the flavor text and should validate the answer.  For example if you puzzle answer is “Excalibur” the last line of your flavor could be “What weapon do you find after solving this puzzle?”  A final answer confirmer is very helpful to our GC as it can cut down on the amount of answer verification required during the night.

### Good and Bad Paths (and no Red Herrings)

A major aim for a beginner puzzle is to ensure that beginner solvers do not spend too much time exploring ‘bad paths’ in a puzzle.  As such special care should be made to make the correct path the most obvious and appealing one.  

Keeping to theme of the set, and using answers that all correspond to the same type/class are easy ways to ensure players keep on the right path.

Likewise, any use of red herrings, intentional or otherwise, are highly discouraged.  Any extraneous text, colors, pictures, etc. can seem important to a novice solver.  Expert solvers are much better at identifying and avoiding rat holes than the novice.

## Acceleration

Acceleration is encouraged in puzzles.  Acceleration is when it becomes easier to solve a puzzle the more it’s been solved.  Crossword puzzles become easier the more answers that have been filled in.  The same with jigsaw, Sudoku, matching, and many other puzzles.

### Team Solving

Puzzled Pint is intended to be a team event.  While teams will often divvy up the puzzles, whenever possible design your puzzles so that more than one person can solve it simultaneously.  

### Power/Back Solving

Often authors will add elements to a puzzle to prevent “power solving” the puzzle.  In short this means taking any kind of shortcut to finish the puzzle in an unintended way.  The most common form of this is to use dictionary searches when only partial letters have been found.  

As we are targeting beginners, avoiding Power Solving should not be a high priority.  We prefer that answers are guessable with incomplete answers/letters because the answer is self-confirming this way.  Most beginners do not use advanced solving tools, and experts are just depriving themselves of the solving experience, as this isn’t a competition.

In short, do not obscure your answer extractions.

### Solving Aids

Some puzzles, especially logic-puzzles might be easier to solve with solving aids like logic-grids or tables to input values.  We encourage providing these to the players, even at the expense of extra paper pages.  Players should not need to construct tables on scratch paper to solve a puzzle.

### Fair Assumptions

Puzzles should not rely on assumptions as to how aspects of puzzle’s mechanism works.  Whenever possible this should be spelled out.  For example, if you have 10 things on the left, and 10 things on the right, it’s a fair assumption that these need to be matched, but for beginners, please say “match each item on the right to one on the left”.

For some puzzles, especially logical deduction puzzles, this might result in a large page of “rules”.  Generally drunken people and beginners will have their eyes glaze over at too many rules, keep this in mind when designing.

### General Knowledge Only

No theme-specific knowledge should be required for your puzzles!  The theme should add flavor and inspiration on mechanisms only. Additionally, we want solvers to rely on general knowledge only.

Examples of general knowledge:

- The top 10,000 or so most commonly used English words and their definitions
- The functioning of household items like blenders
- Top 100 movies of all time
- Top 100 actors of all time

These are not general knowledge:

- Foreign words or their definitions 
- The function of car engine parts (too domain specific)
- TV Shows or their actors (too regional)
- The rules of chess or checkers (surprisingly not generally known, but you can provide a reference)

### Answers

Answers to puzzles should make sense for the puzzle itself, generally thematic and/or fitting the title of the puzzle.  Strange answers that are only meant to serve the meta-puzzle are discouraged, as they are not self-confirming.

Theme-specific answers should be used with caution as they can be too guessable by people who know the theme well, and/or too esoteric for those who don’t know the theme.

### Inclusiveness

Puzzles should attempt to be inclusive of different genders, races, nationalities, sexual preferences, and the like.  Puzzled Pint strives to provide puzzles for all, and when a puzzle exhibits bias, it can be offputting to some.  For example, our February 2017 set had a Puzzle “Cupid’s Followup” that included gay and black couples, while our “Historic Professionals” puzzle from ?/2016 only included men.  The latter could have been made better with one or two notable female professionals, even if it is difficult to find good candidates in our male-dominated history.  In “Cupid’s Followup” the gay and black couples were less well-known, and thus made the puzzle more difficult, but overall the inclusivity made the puzzle better.

## Style & Formatting 

Use this style guide for puzzle sets that don’t have specific theme-driven design.  See [the `resources` folder](./resources/) for fonts and logos related to this design. 

### Puzzles

The title should be in the [Dakota font](./resources/dakota-regular.ttf). Make it a size reasonable to the rest of your puzzle, roughly 24pt, but anywhere between 18-32pt is probably good, depending on the style of your puzzle.

Puzzle text should be in the [Rockwell font](./resources/rockwell.ttf).  It is appropriately weighted and serif-ed to be easily read.

The month's "bug" should be included. Typically, the top-left corner, but the style and layout of your puzzle may dictate it should go somewhere else.

Include a byline, usually in the bottom right. Make it 10pt, gray (50% black), in a Helvetica or Arial. Again, the format of your puzzle may dictate it makes more sense to deviate from this format.

Please submit puzzles in PDF format.  Puzzle editors may later ask for source files (e.g. Word, Excel, Publisher) to assist in final layout.

### Solutions

Typically, this is red text overlaid on the puzzle.  However, use your best judgement to provide the clearest solution you can.  Include explanations of the solving mechanics in the solution.
